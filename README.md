# Hello, fellow builders!<br />You've found your way to the right place!

Feel free to rifle through my repositories. There you'll find some of my projects' source codes and also extra material. Refer to the readme files for documentations.

## A bit about me

I started as a BBA student studying Business Information Technologies in Tampere University of Applied Sciences in 2020, majoring in Software Development. Later I continued my studies at Laurea UAS in Vantaa. **I'm finally graduating in coming months â€“ my degree's lacking only an internship and a thesis project.**

I took my first baby steps into the programming world with object-oriented basics in Java, then I shifted towards mobile development with Android Studio and Kotlin, and later did web development with JS and backend development in Node.js. Working with Git has come beside me right from the start. I've touched also many other things along the way, like writing Swift on xCode, handled databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite, scripting with Python and Bash, working with Linux, and gone through C++ on a very basic level.

Nowadays I'm mostly interested in AWS Cloud, Machine Learning frameworks like PyTorch, and doing Data Science with Python's NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Lonboard, and such.
