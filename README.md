## Biography
Hello, fellow builders! You've found your way to the right place!

I started as a Business Information Technologies student in Tampere University of Applied Sciences in 2020, majoring in Software Development. Since then I shifted over to Laurea UAS, still continuing with software and programming. Soon I'm graduating as a Bachelor of Business Administration. My degree's lacking only an internship and a thesis project (165/210 ECTS).

I took my first baby steps into programming with object-oriented basics in Java, then shifted towards mobile development with Android Studio and Kotlin, and later doing web dev with JS and backend dev in Node.js. Of course, I've also touched many other things along the way, like xCode and Swift, databases like MongoDB and SQLite, Git, Python, Bash, Linux, C++. I like to think I'm very confident in HTML/CSS, MySQL.

Nowadays I'm mostly interested in AWS Cloud, Machine Learning frameworks like PyTorch, and doing Data Science with Python's NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Lonboard, and such.
